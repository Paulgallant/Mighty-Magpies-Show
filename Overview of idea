Hello and welcome to those who will be reading these notes, my name is Paul and a very long time ago when i lived and worked in my home city of Newcastle upon Tyne which i left in 2019 to start over again with no distractions, so the concept at the time could be accomplished according to those i asked as this is two thing's joined seamlessly together, so let's begin i like many others worship Newcastle United football club through my YouTube channel Paul Gallant3675.
Though i no longer live in Newcastle i do still travel up for games at St James Park, and i do see many Magpie birds, so i wanted to combine both in a very fun way showing talking Magpie birds and 4K video of goals being scored or missed, my mission way back then was to have a family of Magpie birds dressed in our kit, watching but sometimes interacting at pitch side.
I wanted this show to be fun amusing and something you have to keep watching so you could learn as well teaching the young people life skills in the show.
Geordie humour and Geordie music a mixture of present super star players and computer generated 4K images/video  of Grandpa Magpie through to baby Magpie with the set being St James Park, (expandable show) now these days we have much faster graphics than we did when i dreamt of this idea, and we now have artificial intellegence helping us as well so it could now be possible combining both.
This family would sit on Leazes Terrace but also flying down into the stadium on a match day, now magpies are small birds and can be found everywhere in the United Kingdom.
For the concept to work fully it will take many people men and women to work on this creating work and more using YouTube as well designing each small Magpie of a family so Grandpa, and wife and father Magpie and wife and their offspring with each show starting with a lap of St James Park including 4K video of Wor flags display from our supporters as people take their seats cutting out the music and replacing said music with my music, that way the show can make money which will be invested in the show.
So there are many roles to be filled in this project designers graphic artists, video editors speech of the family of Magpies with the aim of payments for everyone involveld a pension health care their name in the credits and more
